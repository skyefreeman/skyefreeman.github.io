Trimming down your controllers with builders.

Some of the most involved and repetetive code we write while building an application is the instantiation and setup of our objects.

If we are lucky, we simply set a variable to an initializer and move on.  Early in a development cycle this is common, however what do we do when our objects become gradually more complicated and fragmented?

Abstract away instantiation and setup behind a builder object.
