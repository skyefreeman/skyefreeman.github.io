I'm a Software Developer currently freelancing remotely from the Appalachian Mountains.  My main focus at this time is native iOS, watchOS and tvOS development.  I hack on client projects during the weekdays, tools at night, and side projects on the weekend.

Outside programming, I love to listen to music, hike, lift weights, or read a book.  I also recently began [blogging][website] about my adventures in software.

I'm always open to project inquiries.  If you have an app or app idea, shoot me an [email][mailto] and we can talk about availability and pricing.
